use Google Cloud Platform:

*should also add here: sudo apt install ethereum ethminer

or use AWS instructions here:
    Go to your EC2 console in AWS and change the zone to US-West (N Cali). This zone happens to be the cheapest for the type of instance we’ll be using, and also contains a community AMI that has all the required mining libraries already installed for instant use.
    Under Instances, select Spot Instances and click ‘Request Spot Instances’.
    Search for a community AMI called ami-e326daa7 and select it.  
    Under Instance type choose g2.8xlarge.
    Review and Launch!

How to start mining:
1. get a wallet from myetherwallet.com
2. use Dwarfpool

Simply SSH to your instance and type:
> tmux
> sudo 
> ethminer -G -F http://eth-eu.dwarfpool.com/{WALLET ADDRESS}/{YOUR_EMAIL ADDRESS} --cl-local-work 256 --cl-global-work 16384
*okay, no GPU means we update this command
> ethminer -F http://eth-eu.dwarfpool.com/{WALLET ADDRESS}/{YOUR_EMAIL ADDRESS}
